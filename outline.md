# Outline

## Philosophy of Testing

This part of the book describes the basic philosophies that will help one excel
at designing and writing tests and test infrastructure.

## Domain-Specific Strategies

These are testing stategies that are specific to certain "knowledge domains".
For instance, strategies for testing database-dependent PHP websites are
different than those for testing command-line Python code.

## Language-Specific Info

Each language has a different cultural attitude towards testing, different
selection of test frameworks and libraries and often-times different names for
the same thing. Understanding the underlying philosophy of testing and
domain-specific stategies unifies these seemingly separate ways of doing
things.

## Glossary

A testing glossary, which will act as a rosetta stone for the various and
often conflicting or ambiguous terminologies across various languages.
