=head2 BDD

Behavior Driven Development

=head2 mocking

Mocking is a technique where you "fake out" parts of your code to facilitate
testing. For example, if you wanted to test that your code behaved correctly
when the disk is full, you can "mock" the function which returns how much disk
space is left to return 0, and then test that your code reacts correctly. This
is a whole lot easier and faster than actually filling up the disk.

One important point that many novice testers don't quite get is that you should
never mock the code you are actually testing. Instead, you mock code that it
*depends* on or reacts to, such as the above example.

=head2 fixture

A fixture is really just a fancy name for "test data".
