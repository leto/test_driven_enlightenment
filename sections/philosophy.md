=head1 Philosophy of Testing

The field of automated software testing is a mixture of an art and science.
Different folks have different needs that they want satisfied and hence, they
approach testing very differently.

The more important code is to your business or lifestyle, the more important
writing tests and running tests becomes

=head2 Tests First, or Code First?

There are many people in the testing world that say all your hair will fall out
and you will die alone if you don't write your tests *first* and then add the
code later. They like to use terms like "Test Driven Development" or "Behavior
Driven Development" to describe this philosophy.

There is nothing wrong with this philosophy, but experience has taught me that
hard and fast rules rarely hold up to the test of the real world. Like many
things, some kind of "Pareto Principle" is applicable, i.e. 80% of the time,
you should probably write tests first, but around 20% of the time, it may make
more sense to let the code flow first. Letting the code flow first is sometimes
beneficial at the very beginning of a project, where the coder is starting from
a blank slate.

Although it is possible to write tests as the absolutely first thing, sometimes
having a tiny bit of structure first helps really helps.
